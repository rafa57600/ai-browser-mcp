# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Browser via MCP + Chromium project aims to create a browser automation system that exposes browser control capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This system will allow AI agents and IDEs to programmatically control a Chromium browser instance, capture screenshots, interact with web pages, monitor network activity, and export debugging information. The solution will provide secure, isolated browser sessions with comprehensive logging and reporting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to control a browser programmatically through MCP tools, so that I can automate web testing and debugging workflows from my IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a Chromium browser instance using Playwright
2. WHEN a client connects to the MCP server THEN the system SHALL expose browser control tools via JSON-RPC
3. WHEN browser.newContext is called THEN the system SHALL create an isolated browser context with specified viewport and user agent
4. IF no viewport is specified THEN the system SHALL use default viewport settings of 1280x720

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to navigate to web pages and interact with elements, so that I can perform automated testing and data extraction tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser.goto is called with a URL THEN the system SHALL navigate to the specified page and wait for load completion
2. WHEN browser.click is called with a selector THEN the system SHALL click the matching DOM element
3. WHEN browser.type is called with selector and text THEN the system SHALL input the text into the matching form field
4. WHEN browser.select is called with selector and value THEN the system SHALL select the specified option from a dropdown
5. IF a selector matches multiple elements THEN the system SHALL interact with the first matching element

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to capture visual and structural information from web pages, so that I can analyze page content and debug layout issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser.screenshot is called THEN the system SHALL capture a PNG image of the current page
2. WHEN browser.screenshot is called with fullPage option THEN the system SHALL capture the entire page including scrollable content
3. WHEN browser.screenshot is called with selector option THEN the system SHALL capture only the specified element
4. WHEN browser.domSnapshot is called THEN the system SHALL return a JSON representation of the DOM structure
5. IF maxNodes parameter is specified THEN the system SHALL limit the DOM snapshot to the specified number of nodes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute JavaScript code in the browser context, so that I can extract data and perform custom interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser.eval is called with JavaScript code THEN the system SHALL execute the code in the browser context
2. WHEN JavaScript execution completes THEN the system SHALL return JSON-serializable results
3. IF JavaScript execution throws an error THEN the system SHALL return an error response with details
4. WHEN JavaScript returns non-serializable objects THEN the system SHALL convert them to serializable format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor network activity and console logs, so that I can debug web application issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser.network.getRecent is called THEN the system SHALL return recent network requests and responses
2. WHEN browser.console.getRecent is called THEN the system SHALL return recent console log entries
3. WHEN limit parameter is specified THEN the system SHALL return only the specified number of recent entries
4. WHEN network monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL capture request/response headers and status codes
5. WHEN console logging is active THEN the system SHALL capture all log levels (info, warn, error, debug)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the browser automation to be secure and privacy-aware, so that sensitive data is protected during automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing a new domain THEN the system SHALL check against an allowlist and request user permission
2. WHEN capturing network data THEN the system SHALL filter out sensitive headers like Authorization and Cookies
3. WHEN creating browser contexts THEN the system SHALL use isolated, temporary profiles
4. WHEN operations exceed timeout limits THEN the system SHALL terminate them and return timeout errors
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL reject requests with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate browser automation with my IDE, so that I can access browser tools directly from my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VS Code extension is installed THEN the system SHALL provide commands to start/stop the browser
2. WHEN browser screenshots are captured THEN the system SHALL display them in an IDE webview
3. WHEN console logs are available THEN the system SHALL display them in the IDE output panel
4. WHEN the MCP server is running THEN the system SHALL maintain WebSocket/HTTP communication with the IDE
5. IF connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export comprehensive debugging reports, so that I can analyze and share browser automation results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN export is requested THEN the system SHALL generate an HTML/PDF report containing screenshots, logs, and DOM snapshots
2. WHEN browser.trace.start is called THEN the system SHALL begin recording browser performance traces
3. WHEN browser.trace.stop is called THEN the system SHALL stop recording and make trace data available
4. WHEN browser.harExport is called THEN the system SHALL export network activity in HAR format
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include timestamps and session metadata

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to record and replay browser interaction sequences, so that I can reproduce bugs and automate repetitive testing scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN macro recording starts THEN the system SHALL capture all user interactions and page navigations
2. WHEN macro recording stops THEN the system SHALL save the sequence as a replayable script
3. WHEN a macro is executed THEN the system SHALL replay the recorded interactions in sequence
4. WHEN macro execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and stop execution
5. WHEN debugging integration is active THEN the system SHALL allow step-by-step macro execution

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to handle multiple concurrent browser sessions, so that I can run parallel automation tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple clients connect THEN the system SHALL create separate browser contexts for each session
2. WHEN concurrent operations are requested THEN the system SHALL handle them without interference
3. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL clean up associated browser contexts and resources
4. WHEN resource limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests or return capacity errors
5. WHEN sessions are idle for extended periods THEN the system SHALL automatically clean them up
